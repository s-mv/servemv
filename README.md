# Web Server
By smv.
## What is this?
It's a web server. It serves your file at `localhost:3000` by default in the working directory.
## Installing
You need clang installed to build.
```bash
sudo make install
```
Unless you use some other compiler, in which case just use `CC=<compiler>`.
## Running the server
```bash
servemv
```
Currently it just serves `index.html` from the directory you run it in. Lots to add.
